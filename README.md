# A Seminar for Computational Physics
## Conda and Git tutorials

This is a repository of two notebooks I used for a quick seminar for **Computational Physics with Laboratory** (22018) course in [*UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Palermo*](https://www.unipa.it/) held by professor *Grazia Cottone*.

This is an example of a possible `README.md` file which is displayed in the homepage of the repository.

## References

I've used my knowledge only, and tons of documentation.

## Dependencies

If you want to run the code locally make sure to have the following packages:
  * Python 3.8 or above
  * cool package >= 1.0
  * terrible package = 2.3.4

## To-Do
  - [x] making LICENSE, README.md and .gitignore
  - [ ] finally doing Computational Physics exam
  - [ ] graduating
